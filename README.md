# Delhi House Price Prediction

### Introduction

This is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the house prices in Delhi, India based on various parameters such as location, number of rooms, area, etc. The project uses Python and the scikit-learn library to build and evaluate a linear regression model.

### Requirements

The project requires the following packages to be installed                    
NumPy               
Pandas                   
Matplotlib                
Seaborn                
Scikit-learn                     

### Data

The data used in this project is obtained from a publicly available dataset on Kaggle. The dataset contains information on various properties in Delhi and their respective prices.

### Code

The code for the project is written in Python and is organized as follows:          
Importing required libraries and reading the data into a Pandas DataFrame                   
Exploring and cleaning the data                      
Visualizing the relationship between different variables and the house price              
Splitting the data into training and testing sets                
Building and evaluating a linear regression model                       
The code can be run in any IDE or Jupyter Notebook that supports Python.
